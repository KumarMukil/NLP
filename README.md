#  Removing Stopwords in NLP Using NLTK

##  What This Notebook Is About

This notebook explores different ways to remove **stopwords** from text using **NLTK** in Python. It walks through step-by-step examples that show how to clean and refine text data—especially useful when working on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

Here’s a quick look at what we’ve done:

###  Techniques Demonstrated

- **Standard Stopwords Removal**  
  Removed common English words (like “the”, “is”, “in”) from a paragraph on Artificial Intelligence.

- **Custom Stopwords**  
  Created our own list of domain-specific stopwords (like “machines” or “intelligence”) and filtered them out.

- **Numerical Stopwords**  
  Filtered out numeric values, such as years or counts, when they weren’t relevant to the analysis.

- **Single-Character Stopwords**  
  Removed short, one-letter words like “a” or “I” that don’t carry much meaning by themselves.

- **Contextual Stopwords**  
  Focused on words like “will” that might need to be removed in one context but kept in another.

Each example shows how to tokenize the text and apply filters based on the kind of stopwords we want to remove. It’s a simple but powerful way to get cleaner, more meaningful text for NLP projects.

##  What Are Stopwords, Anyway?

**Stopwords** are words that show up a lot in language but usually don’t add much meaning—things like “the”, “and”, “in”, etc. In many NLP tasks, we remove them to focus on the words that really matter.

## 🗂 Types of Stopwords We Worked With

Here’s a breakdown of the types of stopwords this notebook covers:

- **Common Stopwords:**  
  Everyday words that appear frequently in any sentence (e.g., “the”, “in”, “is”).

- **Custom Stopwords:**  
  Words that don’t mean much in a specific context. For instance, in a medical setting, “patient” or “treatment” might be too generic to be useful.

- **Numerical Stopwords:**  
  Numbers like “2025” or “3000” can be skipped when we only care about the meaning of the words.

- **Single-Character Stopwords:**  
  Words like “a”, “I”, or “x” might be left out if they’re not adding value.

- **Contextual Stopwords:**  
  Words that might matter in one context but not in another—like “will”, which is common but might confuse intent-based analysis.
